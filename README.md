# Calculator

Hello everyone, I’m excited to share a simple first calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has a clear button and a backspace button to correct any mistakes. The calculator is fully functional and can be used in any web browser.

I built this calculator as a way to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. I learned a lot about how to create a user interface, how to handle user input, and how to implement the logic of a calculator. I’m really proud of how the calculator turned out, and I hope you find it useful and fun to use.
